# Challenge #3 - Stir it up

We just fixed up Cauldron V4, everything should finally be safe! To get things back in action, we've deployed a WETH and DVT cauldron. To be extra safe, we also had our intern deploy a new version of DegenBox just to have a fresh start. 

Objective: Drain both WETH and DVT cauldrons of their collateral.
