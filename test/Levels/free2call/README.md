# Challenge #1 - free2call

There's been some talk about [Cauldron V4 being vulnerable](https://mirror.xyz/0x5744b051845B62D6f5B6Db095cc428bCbBBAc6F9/47LK6nUpMrVsYzfCYBTyZsc_7t5Sh5onxO8sSEotNMY), so we've tightened up security by only allowing the Bentobox owner to deploy any new Cauldrons. 

Objective: Without deploying any new cauldrons or assuming any owner roles, drain Alice's bentobox WETH balance.
